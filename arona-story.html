                <h2>The Cheerful AI of the Shittim Chest</h2>
                <p>
                    As the system administrator and main AI of the Shittim Chest, Arona is Sensei's first and most cheerful companion. She awakens alongside Sensei, ready to guide them through the complex world of Kivotos.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She is bubbly, energetic, and sometimes a little clumsy, often getting overly excited about recruitment pulls (especially when a blue envelope appears!). Despite her occasional mishaps, her dedication to supporting Sensei is unwavering. She manages all of S.C.H.A.L.E.'s operations from within the tablet, always ready to help with a bright smile and boundless optimism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Her relationship with Sensei is one of deep trust and affection. She is more than just an AI; she is a friend, a guide, and the heart of S.C.H.A.L.E.
